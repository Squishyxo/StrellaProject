Strella members have been working on different features for the website with only HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. We agreed that we want to deliver the whole project as a vue project for many good reasons. In this branch, we will try to transfer the different codes to a vue project as we are learning how to use it with teacher Pim. 

you will need to do the following to view our website
- do an npm install
- npm run serve

then go to the localhost.
